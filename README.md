ESOTK, ESTKK, es3n1n, NeverLose.cc, OTC, GameSense.is and VACBAN.WTF are all skeet/ all onetap; esotk, esoterik, didn't and doesn't crack anything. When I went to release this, he faked Gamesenseis FBI scam, deleted neverlose and made another scam money grab with yet another fake crack , "neverlose.is". These cheats are all the same, and by deleting both he is making all users pay for the same shit skid wrapper and client. They give you whatever you want; and its as easy as  drag and drop a menu into a base client with the configs that those clients that they are known for ( visuals,luas, js, or any other functions functions ) infact these api's bases from these cheats start with Microsoft SDK, API. The origional and only crack of gamesense.pub that I know of was done by  https://interwebz.cc/, and it is what most people call supremacy. He did this by getting skeet users to dump functions while playing. The code is 90% a true skeet paste.You can see this origional source of it here, https://github.com/OneshotGH/supremacy as well as the client for it,  and it shows us how these cheats started off with imgui, and implementing cheat features into the client as well as how the menues were made with imgui and how content features & exploits were added to the client. This makes it really easy to drop in features, and change the menu; with editors like https://github.com/repos/vurtun/nuklear and imgui; this is easy. But I will simplify this even more so for you, by including dear-imgui persona2editor graphical editor. Its easy to draw these menus. In OneshotGH's fork of interwebz.cc he does the same with windows swdk used for https://github.com/OneshotGH/sdk-api. SDK API, and https://github.com/OneshotGH/Monolith.club-LUA-API if you want to use it. I will be embedding luajit https://luajit.org/extensions.html#exceptions api functions will heavily rely on it, importing GO, IMGUI-js, to convert IMGUI-to JS, and OT-DATA to require the javascript to save data to communicate to a datafile using the `save` function so we then add a hook to that datafile in your go application so that the data is continuously "streamed" over the `Reader` channel. " to the cheat using imgui-js. SKEET, neverlose , onetap all require FFI lib ( luajit ) ( see https://gamesensical.gitbook.io/docs/developers/globals for documentation ).

We start with gamesense.pub org on github. notice how he states since they cracked it, well he is they; a this is obvious when he pushes vacban1WTF te the repo. e3s1n is esotk, and he is The creator of " OTC CRACK", neverlose and gamesenese.is  crack? No, its not a crack it OTC 3 was https://github.com/ZaUserA/OneTap-v3-Js this API by, this happens to be VACBAN.wtf's full api documentation of see:npm install onetap-api. OTC v4 now that they moved to cloud service https://www.npmjs.com/package/onetap-cloud-api & in beta is support for ts. https://www.npmjs.com/package/onetap-ts. I use https://github.com/IBM/swift-backend-for-frontend, because it meets the restful prerequisite, swagger.io's compatability, because I am going to want to run a moc server locally, also Building out the Backend for Frontend (BFF) architecture pattern will help you find and fix bugs while you build it.


tomorrow ill finish this doc; and release the loader after ibuild the discord back, it was deleted  by admins again.

I dont play CSGO, I dont HvH, im 37 years; I dont watch TV. I read, I hack, I work. I am an OG in the cheat community. I get involved in online gaming communities. I have never marketed myself, my cheats and i have and always will do my what I do for free. I'd point you to my youtube but its banned. probably been doing this cRaCkCRACKcracK stuff longer than most of you been alive. white hats and black hats are the same; your hire a hacker either for a living or a hustle. Your a slave to money, and you kids deleted the server because I am not doing this free fast enogh for you; idc, this isnt for you then; I am not doing this for attention or $$$, its being done because you asked me to. REDHATS; never dox, steal money, or hire for hacker. I do this because I wanted to provide a safe place free of bad actors to those being victimized by copy & pasters, overlaying  is my charity, my idea, to share creatively and provide a safe envirorment for anyone who is h4xr0x. Cannot be bought. I do what I want, and I wan tto goto bed I will finish this tomorrow.
